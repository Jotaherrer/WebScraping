# Overview 

This repository contains scripts of some of the webscraping projects I've been working on, particularly the ones that I have not scalated, maybe because of lack of time or because of not considering necessary so far.
The range of themes involved include:
* Stock prices and financial data.
* Data analytics.
* NPL processing techniques.
* Cryptocurrencies.
* News.
* Any additional matter I may be interested in.
